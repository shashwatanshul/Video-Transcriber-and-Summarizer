# Groq-Only Migration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the migration from OpenAI fallback to a Groq-only implementation with automatic chunking to handle token limits.

## Changes Made

### 1. AI Services (`ai_services.py`)

#### Removed:

- OpenAI API key initialization
- OpenAI LLM initialization
- All OpenAI fallback logic
- OpenAI imports (`openai`, `langchain_openai`)

#### Added:

- **Chunking functionality**: `chunk_text()` method that splits large text into manageable chunks
- **Token limit handling**: Automatic chunking for transcripts, summaries, and context
- **Groq-only initialization**: Service now requires Groq API key to function

#### Key Features:

- **Smart chunking**: Splits text at sentence boundaries to maintain context
- **Conservative chunk sizes**: Default 3000 tokens for summaries, 2000 for other operations
- **Multi-level chunking**: Additional word-level splitting for very large chunks
- **Multi-chunk processing**: For large content, processes chunks separately then combines results
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages when Groq API key is missing

### 2. Configuration (`config.py`)

#### Removed:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` configuration

#### Updated:

- `GROQ_API_KEY` is now marked as required instead of alternative

### 3. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

#### Removed:

- `openai==1.3.7`
- `langchain-openai==0.0.5`

#### Kept:

- `langchain-groq==0.0.1` (required for Groq integration)
- `openai-whisper` (still needed for transcription)

### 4. Environment Setup (`env_example.txt`)

#### Updated:

- Removed OpenAI API key example
- Updated Groq API key description to indicate it's required
- Removed actual API keys from example file

### 5. Documentation (`README.md`)

#### Updated:

- Prerequisites: Changed from OpenAI to Groq API key
- Configuration examples: Updated environment variables
- Service setup: Updated instructions for Groq instead of OpenAI
- Cost analysis: Updated to reflect free Groq tier
- Architecture diagram: Updated to show Groq LLM instead of OpenAI GPT
- Added note about automatic chunking feature

### 6. Setup Script (`setup.py`)

#### Updated:

- Service configuration check: Now checks for Groq instead of OpenAI
- Import tests: Removed OpenAI import test
- Next steps: Updated to mention Groq instead of OpenAI

## Chunking Implementation

### How It Works

The chunking system automatically splits large text content to stay within Groq's token limits:

```python
def chunk_text(self, text, max_chunk_size=3000):
    """Split text into chunks that fit within Groq's token limits"""
    # More conservative estimation: 1 token â‰ˆ 3 characters for safety
    max_chars = max_chunk_size * 3

    if len(text) <= max_chars:
        return [text]

    chunks = []
    current_chunk = ""
    sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', text)

    for sentence in sentences:
        if len(current_chunk) + len(sentence) <= max_chars:
            current_chunk += sentence + " "
        else:
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append(current_chunk.strip())
            current_chunk = sentence + " "

            if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(current_chunk.strip())

    # If we still have very large chunks, split them further
    final_chunks = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        if len(chunk) > max_chars:
            # Split large chunks into smaller pieces
            words = chunk.split()
            current_piece = ""
            for word in words:
                if len(current_piece) + len(word) + 1 <= max_chars:
                    current_piece += word + " "
                else:
                    if current_piece:
                        final_chunks.append(current_piece.strip())
                    current_piece = word + " "
            if current_piece:
                final_chunks.append(current_piece.strip())
        else:
            final_chunks.append(chunk)

    return final_chunks
```

### Usage in Different Operations

1. **Summary Generation**:

   - Large transcripts are split into chunks
   - Each chunk is summarized separately
   - Results are combined into final summary

2. **MCQ Generation**:

   - Summary is chunked if too long
   - Uses first chunk for question generation
   - Maintains topic selection logic

3. **Topic Extraction**:

   - Summary is chunked if too long
   - Uses first chunk for topic extraction
   - Falls back to default topics if needed

4. **Chat Context**:
   - Video context is chunked if too long
   - Uses first chunk with truncation notice
   - Maintains conversation flow

## Benefits

### 1. Cost Savings

- **Free Groq tier**: No cost for AI operations
- **No OpenAI charges**: Eliminates pay-per-use costs
- **Predictable pricing**: Free tier with generous limits

### 2. Performance

- **Faster inference**: Groq's optimized models
- **No fallback delays**: Direct Groq processing
- **Efficient chunking**: Smart text splitting

### 3. Reliability

- **No token limit errors**: Automatic chunking prevents 413 errors
- **Consistent service**: No dependency on multiple providers
- **Better error handling**: Clear error messages

## Recent Improvements (Token Limit Fix)

### Problem

- Encountered "context_length_exceeded" errors with large content
- Original chunk sizes were still too large for Groq's limits

### Solution

- **Reduced chunk sizes**: From 6000/4000 to 3000/2000 tokens
- **More conservative token estimation**: From 4 chars/token to 3 chars/token
- **Multi-level chunking**: Added word-level splitting for very large chunks
- **Simplified prompts**: Reduced prompt verbosity to save tokens
- **Aggressive chunking**: Ensures no chunk exceeds token limits

### Results

- Eliminates "context_length_exceeded" errors
- Maintains content quality with smaller, focused chunks
- More reliable processing of large videos

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Remove OpenAI imports and dependencies
- [x] Implement chunking functionality
- [x] Update configuration files
- [x] Update documentation
- [x] Update setup scripts
- [x] Test functionality
- [x] Verify error handling
- [x] Fix token limit issues with improved chunking

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Set Up Groq API Key

1. Sign up at [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### 3. Monitor Token Usage

- Groq provides free tier with generous limits
- Large content is automatically chunked
- No manual intervention required

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Groq API key is required"**

   - Ensure `GROQ_API_KEY` is set in `.env` file
   - Verify the API key is valid

2. **Token limit errors**

   - Should not occur with automatic chunking
   - If they do, check chunk size configuration

3. **Import errors**
   - Ensure `langchain-groq` is installed
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic chunk sizing**: Adjust chunk size based on content type
2. **Parallel processing**: Process multiple chunks simultaneously
3. **Caching**: Cache chunk results for better performance
4. **Model switching**: Support for different Groq models

## Conclusion

The migration to Groq-only with chunking provides a more cost-effective, reliable, and efficient solution for video transcription and summarization. The automatic chunking ensures that token limits are never exceeded, while the free Groq tier eliminates ongoing costs.
